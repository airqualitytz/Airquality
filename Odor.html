                <h2>Odour assessments for planning applications</h2>
                <p>NoiseAir have extensive experience in odour assessments. Odour emissions are potentially generated from multiple sources including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commercial kitchens, restaurants and fast food outlets</li>
                    <li>Intensive livestock farming and slurry management</li>
                    <li>Abattoirs</li>
                    <li>Waste water and sewage treatment</li>
                    <li>Waste management and incineration</li>
                    <li>Composting facilities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your project is likely to cause an odour that will impact on its surroundings, or if your proposed development is near to any existing odour sources, an odour assessment may be required as part of your planning application.</p>
                <p>Our consultants have developed longstanding relationships with local authorities and Environmental Health Officers and will happily liaise with them on your behalf to overcome any potential odour issues.</p>
                <p>We aim to give your planning application the best chance of approval, first time.</p>
